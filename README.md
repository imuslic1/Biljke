# Biljke: An app for tracking plant data

This app was developed as part of a project on the "Mobile App Development" course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of The University of Sarajevo.
The app offers multiple functionalities:
* Showing plant data for different purposes in three modes: cooking, botanical and medical
* Ability to add new plants and check the input data online using an API
* Adds photos of the plants automatically upon adding them in the app
* Ability to filter similar plants in any mode by simply tapping on any plant
* Ability to search for plants with a given flower color by their latin name

The app is still in development phase.
